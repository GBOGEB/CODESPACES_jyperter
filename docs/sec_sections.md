SEC-08: complete DMAIC loop (Define → Measure → Analyze → Improve → Control) with round-trip hooks.
SEC-09: artefact visibility + ranking + influence scores, both as a table and JSON graph.
SEC-10: human-readable YAML/MD artefacts: bios.yaml, kpi_template.yml, artefact_index.yml, and README excerpt.
SEC-11: patch & bundle scripts (patch_all.sh, patch_zip_userzip.sh) so you can spit out diffs and zips like a pro.
SEC-12: structured “verbatim” user input with scope + reduced summaries (structured_input.yaml).
SEC-13: smoke/regression tests (basic but real), so there’s at least something to fail besides our hopes.
SEC-14: CD plan & expected outcomes (promotion gates, observability, reproducibility).
SEC-15: generic agent roles for orchestration (pipeline_orchestrator, kpi_tracker, baseline_promoter, report_generator).
SEC-16: dashboard wireframe schema (JSON) to feed a live UI later.
SEC-17: short handover statement, because someone will inevitably ask “what is this?”
