## REQ_019 â€“ Material Selection for Cryogenic Stability

**Description:** The Contractor shall use 304L stainless steel in all cryogenic piping to ensure cryogenic stability and longevity, with a focus on minimizing carbon content.

**Reference:** ASTM A269

**Verification:** Material selection reports, procurement records.

**Validation:** Deliverables: Material compliance reports, Phase: Design, Procurement.

**Rationale:** The low-carbon variant provides welding benefits by eliminating the need for post-weld heat treatment. It also offers improved thermal contraction properties compared to standard 304 stainless steel, ensuring enhanced performance in cryogenic applications.
