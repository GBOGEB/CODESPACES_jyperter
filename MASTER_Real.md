## 2. PROMPTS LIST (to Gather Consistent Details from the Contractor)

Use these prompts whenever you request information or clarification from the Contractor:

1. **Scope Clarification**
   - "Please detail how you have verified there are no missing items in the scope. Outline your technical due diligence process."
2. **Quality Management**
   - "Explain your QA/QC plan in relation to [specific standards/codes]. Provide any known deviations and alternatives."
3. **Full Lifecycle Reliability**
   - "Describe your approach to design for reliability, including MTBF, maintenance intervals, and obsolescence planning."
4. **Maintenance Strategy**
   - "Supply a recommended preventive maintenance schedule and define necessary spares and special tools."
5. **Cost Breakdown**
   - "Provide an itemized cost structure, including costs for obsolescence, system upgrades, and lifecycle support."
6. **Personnel & Training**
   - "Clarify the manpower needs (operator/technician) across the lifecycle and the required training programs."
7. **Control System & Software**
   - "Detail the control system architecture, integration points, data logging strategy, and software maintenance plans."

   - "Explain your plan to ensure safe execution and operation, including PPE requirements, ventilation, or clean-room constraints."
9. **Risk Management**
   - "Highlight key risks (technical, schedule, interface, etc.) and describe your risk mitigation strategies."

## 3. CRITICAL QUESTIONS FOR THE CONTRACTOR

Use these to probe deeper into technical, operational, and commercial aspects. They can be framed as contractual requirements (using “shall”) or included as part of a technical questionnaire.

1. **Scope Completeness**
   - **Question:** "How do you ensure that all interfaces (mechanical, electrical, controls) are fully accounted for to avoid future scope gaps?"
   - **Why it matters:** Ensures the Contractor has fully identified cross-system dependencies.
2. **Codes & Standards**
   - **Question:** "Which codes/standards are you adopting (e.g., ISO, API, IEC) for design and manufacturing, and how do you certify compliance?"
   - **Why it matters:** Confirms alignment on international best practices.
3. **Quality Assurance & Deviations**
   - **Question:** "Please list any deviations from standard specifications or codes. What alternative approaches are proposed, and how are they justified?"
   - **Why it matters:** Deviations can impact quality, cost, and schedule; they must be transparent.
4. **Reliability & Obsolescence**
   - **Question:** "What is your predicted MTBF for critical components? How are end-of-life parts managed and replaced without impacting system availability?"
   - **Why it matters:** Ensures planning and budgeting for downtime and replacements.
5. **Lifecycle Cost & Operator Requirements**
   - **Question:** "Provide a breakdown of operational expenses over the system’s projected 40-year life. How many skilled operators/technicians are required?"
   - **Why it matters:** Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) depends on staffing and reliability strategies.
6. **Preventative Maintenance & Spares**
   - **Question:** "What is the recommended preventative maintenance schedule, and which spares should be stocked on-site versus ordered on-demand?"
   - **Why it matters:** Minimizes unexpected downtime and ensures quick turnaround for repairs.
7. **Integration & Control System**
   - **Question:** "How does your control system handle transitions between operating modes (start-up, steady-state, shutdown) and manage data logging for predictive maintenance?"
   - **Why it matters:** Proper system integration avoids instability, especially with complex cryogenic or high-pressure processes.
8. **Software & Cybersecurity**
   - **Question:** "How do you manage software updates, security patches, and HMI upgrades over the system’s lifecycle?"
   - **Why it matters:** Ensures the system remains secure and up to date.
9. **Training & Knowledge Transfer**
   - **Question:** "What type of training do you provide (classroom, on-the-job, simulation-based)? How do you ensure staff competencies remain current?"
   - **Why it matters:** Well-trained personnel directly impact safe, efficient operations.
10. **Safety & Access**
    - **Question:** "How do you address safety requirements during installation, maintenance, and operation (e.g., O₂ deficiency monitoring, PPE, working-at-height)?"
    - **Why it matters:** Protects workers and equipment; reduces liability and downtime.
11. **Risk Management & Contingency**
    - **Question:** "What are the most significant technical or schedule risks you foresee? What contingency plans do you recommend?"
    - **Why it matters:** Early identification and proactive mitigation strategies can save time and cost.

## How to Use This Document
