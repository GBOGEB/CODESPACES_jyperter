# DMAIC Iteration Report – v4.3

## Define
- Scope: Consolidate all updates into the 5 MASTER CANVAS; implement recursive builder for SR/REQ insertions; propagate impacts; unify export & sync.
- Inputs: MASTER RTM/SR/DTM; batch deltas; OTC/RFO addenda; governance (QPLANT/MINERVA/MMO).

## Measure (KPIs)
- SR→REQ coverage, REQ→Del coverage, %REQ with V&V, interface naming completeness, DOCX style compliance, macro test pass rate, export success rate.

## Analyze
- Legacy duplication; ambiguous numbering on insert; scattered QA/QC references; manual syncs.

## Improve
- Recursive builder with deterministic renumbering; cross‑CANVAS checks; Pandoc/Excel/JSON exports; Word/Excel macro packs; Drive/GitHub sync stubs.

## Control
- Versioning: MASTER_Name_RevN.n (+0.1 per accepted batch), gated merges, weekly KPI snapshot.
