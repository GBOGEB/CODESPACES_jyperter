# DMAIC Canvas â€“ Repository Build v2.1

## Define
Provide a GitHub-ready repository structure with a Colab demo, example CLI script, and CI workflow.

## Measure
Confirm presence of `.gitignore`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, and example scripts.

## Analyze
Identify gaps in documentation and example usage to improve developer onboarding.

## Improve
Added `colab_demo.md`, `examples/cli_run.sh`, and recorded this canvas to track repository build decisions.

## Control
The CI workflow will ensure ongoing quality checks, and the example scripts serve as references for future contributors.
