# Helium System Calculations Report

## Compression Power Requirements

- **Operating conditions:** 350 g/s flow of helium compressed from 1 bar to 15 bar at 300 K.
- **Isothermal ideal power:** approximately 591 kW.
- **Practical oil-flooded screw compressor:** typically 130–170% of the isothermal ideal, giving an estimated **shaft power of 0.8–1.0 MW**.
- **Electrical power:** assuming roughly 50–60% electrical-to-shaft efficiency, the total electrical input is **1.6–2.0 MW**.

## Warm Compressor System (WCS)

| Stream | Mass Flow (g/s) |
|-------|----------------|
| WCS High Pressure (HP) | 350 |
| WCS Low Pressure (LP)  | 300 |
| Very Low Pressure (VLP)| 50  |

## Cold Box Flow Summary

- **Outgoing streams:**
  - 50 g/s to QRB-A.
  - 50 g/s to annulus.
- **Incoming streams:**
  - 47 g/s from B VLP.
  - 3 g/s warm return from Qindra 4.
- **Additional circuits:**
  - QRB-D and QRB-E supply and return lines serving the thermal shield.

These figures consolidate the helium mass-flow paths and power estimates for the system under the specified operating conditions.
